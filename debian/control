Package: libcomerr2
Priority: required
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}
Architecture: any
Description: common error description library
 libcomerr is an attempt to present a common error-handling mechanism to
 manipulate the most common form of error code in a fashion that does not
 have the problems identified with mechanisms commonly in use.

Package: comerr-dev

Description: common error description library - headers and static libraries
 libcom_err is an attempt to present a common error-handling mechanism to
 manipulate the most common form of error code in a fashion that does not
 have the problems identified with mechanisms commonly in use.

Description: command-line interface parsing library
 This package includes a tool that parses a command table to generate
 a simple command-line interface parser, the include files needed to
 compile and use it, and the static libs.
 . 
 It was originally inspired by the Multics SubSystem library.

Package: libuuid1
Priority: required
Depends: passwd, ${shlibs:Depends}
Recommends: uuid-runtime
Architecture: any
Description: universally unique id library
 libuuid generates and parses 128-bit universally unique id's (UUID's).
 See RFC 4122 for more information.

Package: uuid-runtime
Priority: optional
Depends: libuuid1 (>> 1.40.3-1), ${shlibs:Depends}
Architecture: any
Description: universally unique id library
 libuuid generates and parses 128-bit universally unique id's (UUID's).
 See RFC 4122 for more information.
 .
 This package contains the uuidgen program and the uuidd daemon.
 .
 The uuidd daemon is used to generate universally unique identifiers (UUIDs),
 especially time-based UUID’s, in a secure and guaranteed-unique fashion,
 even in the face of large numbers of threads trying to grab UUID’s
 running on different CPU’s. It is used by libuuid as well as the
 uuidgen program.

 This package contains the development environment for the uuid library.

Package: libblkid1
Priority: required
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}
Architecture: any
Description: block device id library
 The blkid library which allows system programs like fsck and 
 mount to quickly and easily find block devices by filesystem UUID and 
 LABEL.  This allows system administrators to avoid specifying 
 filesystems by hard-coded device names, but via a logical naming 
 system instead.

Package: e2fslibs
Priority: required
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}
Architecture: any
Description: ext2 filesystem libraries
 The ext2fs and e2p libraries are used by programs that directly access 
 EXT2 filesystems from usermode programs.   The EXT2 filesystem is very often
 used as the default filesystem on Linux systems.   Various system programs
 that use libext2fs include e2fsck, mke2fs, tune2fs, etc.  Programs that use
 libe2p include dumpe2fs, chattr, and lsattr.
